Calories, calories, calories! This is the one time where fat content and prepackaged foods is a very good thing. You’re trying to survive until help arrives/you find help else where.
little to no food preparation needed. I purposely packed foods that were ‘grab-and-go’…meaning you don’t have to do anything to them to eat them, just open and enjoy.
I also did pack a few items (like hot chocolate and soup) that require water. But that’s it! ‘Just add water’ is as far as I go.


Try to remain in the area you know best. If the zombie plague strikes it’s better to know the best hiding places and ways to avoid the undead.


Try to avoid crowded places like malls and supermarkets. You might get killed by normal, desperate people over a bug of peanuts. Apocalyptical scenarios are the best moments to keep your distance from crowds. They have a mind of their own which where the phrase “crowd mentality” comes from.
