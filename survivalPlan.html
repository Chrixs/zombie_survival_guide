  <p><h4>STEP 1</h4>
    The first you should do is put on as many different layers of clothes as possible.
    (Luckily you live in a cold state and have many winter clothes available)
    Make sure no skin is showing and has several layers.
    This will slow your movement and reflexes but it will also make it harder for them to get a good bite on you.
    FACT: biting through a sweatshirt is difficult and biting through Carhart clothes is nearly impossible.
    Granted that the zombies will have stronger bite strength then humans but that is crushing strength and if you
    double up the sweatshirts and Carhart or other materials it should beable to stop the teeth or nails from breaking the skin.
    (Note that the crushing power of the human jaw is actually enough to crush bones but bones can heal and the Z-infection can not).<p>

      <p><h4>CARDIO is a solid rule. Stay in shape so you don’t tire out at the wrong time</h4></p>
        <p><h4>STEP 2</h4></p>
        <p>Step two is a two part step- first you must arm yourself temporarily ( In Step 4 you will be upgrading)
        Set up a temporary home base of opperations wherever you are (best place could be the second story apt with only one entrance).
        If power is still on at this point you should be inviting people you trust in the area and establish a group of survivors to help.
        If there is an un-dead army out there you'll want to have your own.
        Unlike harry potter you will gladly enlist the help of my friends and family and even strangers.</p>

        <p><h4>STEP 3</h4></p>
        <p>Once you have contacted whoever is close enough to get to your place, you will leave them there to defend while taking all the bags
        you can carry, plus your weapon, and procuring a vehicle preferably a truck, which you will then take to the closest grocery store
        to load up on canned goods and what food you can.</p>

        <p><h4>STEP 4</p></h4>
        <p>The Roads will undoubtably be clogged with traffic.  What we cannot crash our way through we will have to go around.
        Using the ducks to travel a combination of rivers and road we will head to the West, but not west of the rockies.
        You will want to go to less congested areas for mulitple reasons.<br>  1) less people = less zombies..  there are huge sprawling cities,
        but there are also a lot of very small towns and probably the Z’s will group up in the cities <br> 2) wide flat spaces = seeing them
        coming after you ( at least better than say in the woods) You don't want want anything to sneak up on you. <br>3) Stay Mobile:  probably all the small towns will be full of supplies
        (food, water, weapons, and radios)and all that will make staying on the move easier.</p>

        <p><h4>SIDENOTES</h4></p>
        <p>
          Once a person is bit there is usually a window of time before they turn into one. No way you are going to take them out before they turn. This can be a chance at their redemption. If someone in your group gets bit that person can get a weapon and a chance to take out as many of them as possible before the person turns. If everyone goes down fighting we can slowly even the numbers.
        Lots of people talk about zombies going underwater. Zombies totally could walk under water! BUT  since they would not have to breath and they have a lot of empty space in them (granted this will vary z-to-z) they might fill up with water and be even slower that normal. They would be able to climb up anchors or ropes if they are within reach but for sure it will be a struggle for them.</p>
