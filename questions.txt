<li> Team up with other survivors In case of a zombie apocalypse, human company is ever so helpful.</li>
<li> Don’t forget to pack fresh underpants and socks. You never know when you return…</li>
<li> Travel with pensioners. Senior citizens make for spritely and vigorous fighters (and are slower than you).</li>
<li> Rub curry sauce all over you. You will look a monstrocity and the pungent smell will cover up your human aroma. But be careful: Not only zombies, but also fellow soldiers can take you for someone undead.</li>
<li> Use common sense. Don’t elect a psychopath as your leader, and always keep your group together. This isn’t a ‘Scooby-Doo’ mystery — you’re trying to stay alive.
  No matter how tempting it is, never split up. There’s strength in numbers. When it’s just you and 120 zombies, your odds of survival decrease significantly.</li>
<li> And most important of all (besides not getting bit), have a back up for everything. Back up generators, batteries, ammunition, food, escape routes, weapons supplies, vehicles, leaders and so on, ad infinitum.
  When the gooey zombie juice hits the fan, every second counts. By the time you say, “Now where did I leave my extra gun clip,” some greasy monster just back from the dead will have already ripped your arm off, or your head. (Plan ahead with this handy “map of the dead.”)
  You’ve got to be smart out there, and stay ahead of the pack. Remember, the dead don’t sleep. If one of them catches you snoozing on the job unprepared, it will simply add you to the zombie ranks, or turn you into an all-you-can-eat buffet.
  Good luck out there. And keep your brains where they belong — in your head.</li>
<li> If you like wearing heels, unlucky, time to get rid of all of your high heel shoes.
  Get hold of some sturdy boots that will last, as well as some trail shoes built for speed, because you’re going to be doing an awful lot of running.</li>
