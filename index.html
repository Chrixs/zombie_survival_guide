    <ol>
      <li>Water is vital, collecting rain water is a good source of potable water, rivers, streams and lakes are also good places to find water, but make sure to purify it before drinking.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have a survival kit put together, this could consist of a fire lighter, tinder (cotton, newspaper, etc...), a knife, para cord, fishing line/hook and a torch.</li>
      <li>A map and compass are vital for making sure you can plan your journey andget to where you want to go without getting lost.</li>
      <li>A lightweight and compact sleeping bag is vital for survival. You don’t want something too bulky or heavy as you will be hauling it in your bag everywhere you go. You also don’t want something too uncomfortable to sleep in every night. Getting good rest and sleep means proper rejuvenation to prepare for the next zombie attack.</li>
      <li>Hygene is just as important as everything else on this list, this will include a toothbrush, nail clippers and things like spare underwear and socks, don’t use ordinary socks. The recommendations below are socks that trap heat close to your body for exceptional insulation and provide superior moisture management.</li>
      <li>White gold (toilet paper).</li>
      <li>A tactical sandwich is imperative and should be your first port of call. A footlong now will be a lifesaver later. Zombie killing is hungry work!</li>
      <li>No crisps! Crisps are a big no no, the rustling will attract zombies.</li>
      <li>No capes!</li>
      <li>Weapons, for defense against the dead AND the living.</li>
