<h5>STEPS</h5>
<br></br>
<li>Start by using a knife to slice off a piece of cork.</li>
<li>Hold the needle in one hand and slide one side of the bar magnet along the length of the needle.   It is important that you donâ€™t slide the magnet back and forth on the needle.   Just slide it in one direction, lift it up, and repeat. Repeated this about 50 times which is probably many more times than needed. But now the needle is a magnet!</li>
<li>Pour water into the plastic lid</li>
<li>Place the cork in the water and put the needle on top of the cork.   It may take a minute to get the needle balanced well on the cork but eventually it will smoothly spin so that the needle points to the North.</li>
