<h5>STEPS</h5>
<br></br>
<li>help by using a knife to slice off a piece of cork.   This cork was a bottle stopper left over from some decorative bottle we once had.   A wider piece of cork might work better though.</li>
<li>This step was fun.   My son made his own magnet!   He held the needle in one hand and slid one side of the bar magnet along the length of the needle.   It is important that you don’t slide the magnet back and forth on the needle.   Just slide it in one direction, lift it up, and repeat.   He repeated this about 75 times which is probably many more times than needed.   But now the needle is a magnet!</li>
 pour water into the plastic lid</li>
<li>Place the cork in the water and put the needle on top of the cork.   It may take a minute to get the needle balanced well on the cork but eventually it will smoothly spin so that the needle points to the North.   I really couldn’t believe that my son had just made his own compass so we got out a real compass to check the results.   Yep, it was pointing to the North!</li>
<li>When you’ve collected enough purified water (be patient- it can take a day or two), you can taste the water to see how your purifier worked.</li>
<li>Be sure to wipe of the bottom of the collection bowl before you pour it out so you don’t contaminate your clean water!</li>
