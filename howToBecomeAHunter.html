HOW TO BECOME THE HUNTER
<br></br>
The main scenario is that, at first stages of the zombie apocalypse, we are going to be the hunted but in the end, we will become the hunters.
This is why you need to know which weapons are most efficient and how to actually kill a zombie.
It may seem like a redundant thing to do, considering the fact that it is already dead and reanimated but, if we’re talking about slower zombies you will have time to execute.

Anoter scenario is the outbreak of a virus that makes all those infected extremely violent. In this situation the best solution might be finding a cure or a vaccine.
 Even so, this may take a while and you’ll still be in the need of a zombie survival gear to protect yourself and other survivors.

It seems that regardless of the situation, as a survivor, you must be ready to fight.
So, how do you actually kill a zombie? The most effective way is to cut off its head; simple and efficient in all situations.

Here are the basic items your zombie survival gear should contain:

Big, sharpened ax. You have to be able to swing it and hit with precision and power.
Rifle, assault rifle or shotgun with plenty of ammo (blowing their heads off is also efficient). A great shotgun is the Winchester Super X Pump Defender.
Hatchet and/or machete (perfect for close fights).
Military or combat knife (easy to handle and really sharp).
Baseball bat
You don’t have to wear all that gear with you. You don’t even have to own all these weapons; one will be enough.
Pick your favorite and take good care of it. When the time comes, it may be the only thing standing between you and a life of brain cravings!
